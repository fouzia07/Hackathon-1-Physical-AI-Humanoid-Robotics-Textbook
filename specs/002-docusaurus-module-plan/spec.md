# Feature Specification: Docusaurus Module Plan for ROS 2 Textbook

**Feature Branch**: `002-docusaurus-module-plan`
**Created**: 2025-12-24
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "# Module 1 Plan (Docusaurus)

1. Install and initialize **Docusaurus**, configure it for a textbook layout, and create the `modules/` directory with `module-1-ros2/` containing three chapter files.
2. Populate each chapter with **Concept → System → Practice** content, ensuring clean headings, learning objectives, and summaries for RAG-ready indexing.
3. All documentation files must use the **`.md`** format only."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Docusaurus Setup and Configuration (Priority: P1)

As a content developer, I want to install and configure Docusaurus with a textbook layout so I can create educational content in a structured format that supports learning objectives and summaries.

**Why this priority**: Without a properly configured Docusaurus setup, no educational content can be created or published.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by verifying that Docusaurus is installed, configured for textbook layout, and that the modules directory structure with module-1-ros2 is created.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a development environment, **When** I run the Docusaurus installation and configuration process, **Then** Docusaurus is properly initialized with textbook layout settings
2. **Given** the need for module organization, **When** I configure the directory structure, **Then** the `modules/module-1-ros2/` directory is created with appropriate substructure for three chapter files

### User Story 2 - Chapter Content Creation (Priority: P2)

As an educational content creator, I want to populate each chapter with Concept → System → Practice content structure so that students can follow a pedagogically sound learning path with clear learning objectives and summaries.

**Why this priority**: Content creation is the core value of the textbook and enables the educational mission.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating a single chapter that follows the Concept → System → Practice structure with proper headings, learning objectives, and summaries.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a chapter template, **When** I populate it with content following the Concept → System → Practice structure, **Then** the chapter includes clear learning objectives and summaries
2. **Given** the need for RAG-ready indexing, **When** I format the content with clean headings, **Then** the content can be properly indexed for retrieval

---

### User Story 3 - Format Compliance (Priority: P3)

As a content publisher, I want to ensure all documentation files use the .md format only so that the content remains consistent and compatible with the Docusaurus framework.

**Why this priority**: Format consistency is essential for proper rendering and maintenance of the textbook.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by verifying that all created files use the .md extension and contain properly formatted markdown content.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a set of created content files, **When** I check the file formats, **Then** all files use the .md extension
2. **Given** the requirement for RAG-ready content, **When** I verify the content structure, **Then** all files include proper headings, learning objectives, and summaries

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the content exceeds typical chapter length?
- How does the system handle complex diagrams or multimedia that might be needed for ROS 2 concepts?
- What if the user needs to update the Docusaurus configuration after initial setup?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST install and initialize Docusaurus in the development environment
- **FR-002**: System MUST configure Docusaurus with textbook layout settings appropriate for educational content
- **FR-003**: System MUST create the directory structure with `modules/` and `module-1-ros2/` subdirectories
- **FR-004**: System MUST create three chapter files within the module-1-ros2 directory
- **FR-005**: System MUST populate each chapter with Concept → System → Practice content structure
- **FR-006**: System MUST ensure each chapter includes clear learning objectives and summaries
- **FR-007**: System MUST format all content with clean headings for RAG-ready indexing
- **FR-008**: System MUST ensure all documentation files use the .md format only
- **FR-009**: System MUST ensure content is structured to support educational pedagogy

### Key Entities

- **Docusaurus Installation**: The documentation framework that will host the textbook content
- **Textbook Modules**: Organized content sections (e.g., modules/module-1-ros2/) containing educational material
- **Chapter Files**: Individual .md files containing educational content following Concept → System → Practice structure
- **Educational Content**: Structured learning materials with learning objectives, summaries, and clean headings

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Docusaurus is successfully installed and configured with textbook layout settings
- **SC-002**: The directory structure `modules/module-1-ros2/` is created with three chapter files
- **SC-003**: All chapter files follow the Concept → System → Practice structure with learning objectives and summaries
- **SC-004**: All content files use the .md format and include clean headings for RAG-ready indexing
