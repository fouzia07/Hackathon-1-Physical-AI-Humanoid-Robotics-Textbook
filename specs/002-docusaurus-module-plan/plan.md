# Implementation Plan: Docusaurus Module Plan for ROS 2 Textbook

**Branch**: `002-docusaurus-module-plan` | **Date**: 2025-12-24 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/002-docusaurus-module-plan/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/sp.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

This plan outlines the implementation of a Docusaurus-based textbook module for ROS 2 content. The primary requirement is to install and configure Docusaurus with a textbook layout, create the appropriate directory structure (`modules/module-1-ros2/`), and populate three chapter files with Concept → System → Practice content structure. The implementation will ensure clean headings, learning objectives, and summaries for RAG-ready indexing, with all files using the .md format.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Node.js LTS, JavaScript/TypeScript for Docusaurus framework
**Primary Dependencies**: Docusaurus 3.x, React, Node.js package ecosystem
**Storage**: File-based content storage using .md files in modules directory structure
**Testing**: N/A (content-focused project without application logic)
**Target Platform**: Web-based textbook accessible via GitHub Pages
**Project Type**: Static site generation for educational content
**Performance Goals**: Fast loading times for educational content, SEO-friendly indexing
**Constraints**: All content must use .md format, follow Concept → System → Practice pedagogical flow, RAG-ready indexing compatibility
**Scale/Scope**: Module 1 for ROS 2 textbook with 3 chapters, extensible for additional modules

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- Spec-driven, deterministic generation: Ensure all processes are reproducible and auditable (COMPLIANT: Following spec-driven approach with Docusaurus setup and content creation)
- Technical accuracy and verifiability: Verify all technical claims are accurate and verifiable (COMPLIANT: Content will be based on verified ROS 2 documentation and concepts)
- Clear pedagogical flow: Confirm content follows Concept → System → Practice progression (COMPLIANT: Feature requirement explicitly includes Concept → System → Practice structure)
- Modular, AI-native design: Validate architecture supports AI integration (COMPLIANT: Docusaurus framework supports AI integration and RAG)
- RAG chatbot integrity: Verify chatbot only responds with indexed content (COMPLIANT: Docusaurus content will be indexable for RAG systems)
- Content standards compliance: Ensure adherence to Markdown, Docusaurus, and deployment standards (COMPLIANT: Feature explicitly requires .md format and Docusaurus compatibility)

```

**Structure Decision**: The project follows a Docusaurus-based textbook structure with educational modules organized in the docs/modules/ directory. The three required chapter files will be created in the module-1-ros2/ subdirectory, following the Docusaurus documentation site conventions while maintaining compatibility with the required Concept → System → Practice pedagogical flow.
