# Tasks: Docusaurus Module Plan for ROS 2 Textbook

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/002-docusaurus-module-plan/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: No explicit tests required per feature specification - this is content-focused project without application logic.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Docusaurus textbook**: `docs/`, `src/`, `static/` at repository root
- **Module content**: `docs/modules/module-1-ros2/` for ROS 2 content
- **Configuration**: `docusaurus.config.js`, `sidebars.js` at root

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic Docusaurus structure

- [ ] T001 Install Node.js LTS and npm package manager
- [ ] T002 [P] Initialize Docusaurus project with classic template in repository root
- [ ] T003 [P] Configure basic Docusaurus settings in docusaurus.config.js
- [ ] T004 Create module directory structure: docs/modules/module-1-ros2/

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [ ] T005 Configure sidebar navigation in sidebars.js to include module-1-ros2
- [ ] T006 Set up basic Docusaurus configuration for textbook layout
- [ ] T007 [P] Create placeholder files for three chapter files in docs/modules/module-1-ros2/

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Docusaurus Setup and Configuration (Priority: P1) 🎯 MVP

**Goal**: Install and configure Docusaurus with textbook layout, create modules directory structure with module-1-ros2 containing three chapter files

**Independent Test**: Docusaurus is installed, configured for textbook layout, and the modules/module-1-ros2/ directory is created with appropriate substructure for three chapter files

### Implementation for User Story 1

- [ ] T008 [P] Create chapter-1-ros2-fundamentals.md with basic frontmatter in docs/modules/module-1-ros2/
- [ ] T009 [P] Create chapter-2-ros2-communication.md with basic frontmatter in docs/modules/module-1-ros2/
- [ ] T010 [P] Create chapter-3-python-agents-urdf.md with basic frontmatter in docs/modules/module-1-ros2/
- [ ] T011 Update docusaurus.config.js with textbook-specific settings
- [ ] T012 Configure sidebar to properly display module-1-ros2 in sidebars.js
- [ ] T013 Verify Docusaurus development server starts with new module structure

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Story 1 should be fully functional and testable independently

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Chapter Content Creation (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Populate each chapter with Concept → System → Practice content structure, ensuring clean headings, learning objectives, and summaries for RAG-ready indexing

**Independent Test**: A single chapter follows the Concept → System → Practice structure with proper headings, learning objectives, and summaries

### Implementation for User Story 2

- [ ] T014 [P] [US2] Populate chapter-1-ros2-fundamentals.md with Concept → System → Practice structure
- [ ] T015 [P] [US2] Populate chapter-2-ros2-communication.md with Concept → System → Practice structure
- [ ] T016 [P] [US2] Populate chapter-3-python-agents-urdf.md with Concept → System → Practice structure
- [ ] T017 [US2] Add learning objectives section to each chapter file
- [ ] T018 [US2] Add proper summary section to each chapter file
- [ ] T019 [US2] Ensure clean heading hierarchy (h1, h2, h3) for RAG indexing in all chapters
- [ ] T020 [US2] Verify all chapters follow pedagogical flow: Concept → System → Practice

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Stories 1 AND 2 should both work independently

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Format Compliance (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Ensure all documentation files use the .md format only so that content remains consistent and compatible with Docusaurus framework

**Independent Test**: All created files use the .md extension and contain properly formatted markdown content

### Implementation for User Story 3

- [ ] T021 [P] [US3] Validate all chapter files use .md extension only
- [ ] T022 [P] [US3] Verify all chapter files follow proper markdown format
- [ ] T023 [US3] Check that all content files are valid markdown with proper syntax
- [ ] T024 [US3] Ensure no non-markdown files exist in docs/modules/module-1-ros2/
- [ ] T025 [US3] Validate that all files meet RAG-ready indexing requirements

**Checkpoint**: All user stories should now be independently functional

---

## Phase 6: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Improvements that affect multiple user stories

- [ ] T026 [P] Review all chapter content for technical accuracy and verifiability
- [ ] T027 [P] Ensure content follows pedagogical flow: Concept → System → Practice
- [ ] T028 Verify all content meets educational standards and learning objectives
- [ ] T029 Test Docusaurus build process to ensure all content renders correctly
- [ ] T030 Validate RAG indexing capability with clean headings and structure
- [ ] T031 Run quickstart validation to ensure textbook layout works properly
- [ ] T032 Final review of all content for consistency and quality

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 → P2 → P3)
- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Depends on US1 (needs chapter files)
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Depends on US1/US2 (needs created files)

### Within Each User Story

- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- Models within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 2

```bash
# Launch all chapter content creation tasks together:
Task: "Populate chapter-1-ros2-fundamentals.md with Concept → System → Practice structure"
Task: "Populate chapter-2-ros2-communication.md with Concept → System → Practice structure"
Task: "Populate chapter-3-python-agents-urdf.md with Concept → System → Practice structure"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 3 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1
   - Developer B: User Story 2
   - Developer C: User Story 3
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Verify tests fail before implementing
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created comprehensive task list for Docusaurus Module Plan for ROS 2 Textbook with 32 specific, actionable tasks organized by user story priority
- 🧪 Tests: No tests required for content-focused project
- 📁 Files: specs/002-docusaurus-module-plan/tasks.md, referencing specs/002-docusaurus-module-plan/spec.md, specs/002-docusaurus-module-plan/plan.md, specs/002-docusaurus-module-plan/data-model.md, specs/002-docusaurus-module-plan/research.md, specs/002-docusaurus-module-plan/quickstart.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for implementation using /sp.implement or manual execution of tasks
- 🧠 Reflection: Tasks properly organized by user story priority with clear dependencies and parallel execution opportunities identified
